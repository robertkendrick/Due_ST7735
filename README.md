Adafruit ST7735 library modifed to run on DUE


Phase 1 mods to Adafruit's great ST7735 library to run on the Arduino Due.  Tested with the graphictest example. 
Works fine.
Mods are untidy and unoptimised. This is work for phase 2.

Note: When you compile your sketch you will get a number of messages from the compiler saying things
 like ... Compiling for DUE. Do not confuse these with error messages. I included these messages in order 
 to figure out what the compiler was doing at certain stages.
